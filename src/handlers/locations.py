üí° A location is a projection of the 
real place of  your life into the game. 
For example, the game location "Home" is a 
reflection of your real-life home.

Popular: Home, Work, School, Gym, Park

So, if you want to do a real-life task - 
you can add it is in your game location. 
For example, if you wanted to clean the 
house in real life, you could make reflections 
of that task as a quest in the game

So, type a location name:
