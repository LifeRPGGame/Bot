üí° A location is a projection of the 
real place of your life into the game. 

For example, the game location "Home" is a 
reflection of your real-life home.

So, if you want to do a real-life task - 
you can add it is in your game location. 

For example, if you wanted to clean the 
house in real life, you could make reflections 
of that task as a quest in the game
